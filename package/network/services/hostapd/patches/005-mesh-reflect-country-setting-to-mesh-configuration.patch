Subject: [PATCH 05/16] mesh: reflect country setting to mesh configuration

wpa_supplicant configuration has country parameter that is
supposed to be used in AP mode to indicate supporting 802.11h
and 802.11d. Reflect this configuration to Mesh also since Mesh
is required to support 802.11h and 802.11d to use DFS channels.
